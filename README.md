## Getting started

please use colab to open the file "inference.py"
just execute this file on colab,

it will automatically load the model and reproduce submission file



## Training 
be specified in `src/configs.py`. 


## Future work:

If there is time, I will try to adjust the learning rate and try to unfreeze only a portion of layers gradually while training.
